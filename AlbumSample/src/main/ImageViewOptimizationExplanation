The utility classes were written referring to the nice tutorial by Antoine Merle
@ http://antoine-merle.com/listview-optimisations-part-2-displaying-images-in-your-lists/
Thanks to him. 

As explained in the comments within the code and also in the above mentioned tutorial, the image to 
be retrieved from the server is first checked for its existence in the LRUCache, if it does not exist 
then a second check is made in the FileCache, if it does not exist in FileCache too, then only
a request is made to the server and the image is downloaded. The actual download of image is done in an
asynchronous task, keeping the UI responsive and updating images immediately after they are downloaded.
The FileCache uses explicit saving of the images on the device storage, having hashcode of its URL as 
a key to access later.
